        <p>One of the most challenging topics in an introduction to computing course is programming. Programming is the process of writing code to create computer programs. It can be a difficult concept to grasp, as it requires you to think in a logical and structured way. There are also many different programming languages, each with its own syntax and rules.

            One of the things that makes programming challenging is that it is a creative endeavor. There is often more than one way to solve a programming problem, and you need to be able to come up with the most efficient and effective solution. Programming also requires you to be able to debug your code, which means finding and fixing errors.<p>

            <p>This is my motorcycle that my parents gave me as a present on my graduation because they know howmuch I want to have a motorcycle and they gave me because the main street is far from our house that makes me walk a kilometer to get a ride that's why having this motorcycle that my parents gave me is a convenient for me as a student.</p>
